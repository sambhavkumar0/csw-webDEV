<div style="padding-bottom: 2000px">
<p>Gentlemen of the Congress: Once more, as repeatedly before, the spokesmen of
the Central Empires have indicated their desire to discuss the objects of war and the
possible basis of a general peace. Parleys have been in progress at Brest-Litovsk between
Russian representatives and representatives of the Central Powers to which the attention
of all the belligerents has been invited for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may
be possible to extend these parleys into a general conference with regard to terms of
peace and settlement. The Russian representatives presented not only a perfectly deﬁ-
nite statement of the principles upon which they would be willing to conclude peace, but
also an equally deﬁnite program of the concrete application of those principles. The
representatives of the Central Powers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement
which, if much less deﬁnite, seemed susceptible of liberal interpretation until their
speciﬁc program of practical terms was added. That program proposed no concessions at
all, either to the sovereignty of Russia or to the preferences of the populations with
whose fortunes it dealt, but meant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep
every foot of territory their armed forces had occupied every province, every city, every
point of vantage as a permanent addition to their territories and their power. It is a
reasonable conjecture that the general principles of settlement which they at ﬁrst sug-
gested originated with the more liberal statesmen of Germany and Austria, the men who
have begun to feel the force of their own peoples thought and purpose, while the con-
crete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but
to keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The Russian repre-
sentatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest
and domination. The whole incident is full of signiﬁcance. It is also full of perplexity.
With whom are the Russian representatives dealing? For whom are the representatives of
the Central Empires speaking? Are they speaking for the majorities of their respective
parliaments or for the minority parties, that military and imperialistic minority which
has so far dominated their whole policy and controlled the affairs of Turkey and of the
Balkan States which have felt obliged to become their associates in this war?</p>
